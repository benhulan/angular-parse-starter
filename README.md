# Angular Auth with Parse

Instructions pending.

Steps:

Get boilerplate code (from cloning this repo).
Sign up for Parse account.
Navigate to Settings and find your `ApplicationId` and `JavascriptKey`.
Add them to the `Parse.initialize()` function call in your `app.js` file.

```javascript
Parse.initialize("ApplicationId",
  "JavascriptKey");
```

TODO:
[ ] Add information about building out the rest of the boilerplate app.
[ ] Add instructions about making a new model and controller for posting/querying data.
